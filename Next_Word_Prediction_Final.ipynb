        "Consider sequential data, which may be found in the stock market for a certain stock. A basic machine learning model or an Artificial Neural Network may learn to anticipate stock prices based on a variety of factors such as the stock's volume, opening value, and so on. While these characteristics influence the stock's price, it is also influenced by the stock's prior day's value. In reality, for a trader, the previous days' values (or the trend) are a crucial determining element in making forecasts.\n",

        "RNNs can help us with sequence management to a degree, but not completely. Our goal is for our computers to be capable of writing Shakespearean sonnets. RNNs are wonderful for brief contexts, but we need our models to be able to grasp and recall the context behind the sequences, just like a human brain, in order to form a storey and remember it. With a basic RNN, this is not achievable."

        "\n",
        "When dealing with short-term dependencies, recurrent neural networks are ideal. RNNs have shown to be quite successful. This is because the issue has nothing to do with the statement's context. The RNN doesn't have to recall what was stated before this or what it meant; all they need to know is that the sky is usually blue. Vanilla RNNs, on the other hand, are unable to comprehend the context of an input. When making forecasts in the present, it is impossible to remember what was said in the past.\n",
        "We may deduce from this that, having worked in Spain for 20 years, the author is likely to have a decent grasp of the language. However, in order to produce an accurate forecast, the RNN must remember the context. A large amount of unnecessary data may distance the relevant information from the point when it is required. A Recurrent Neural Network fails in this situation!\n",
        "The cause for this is the Vanishing Gradient issue. You'll need some understanding of how a feed-forward neural network learns in order to grasp this. We know that the weight update done on a specific layer in a standard feed-forward neural network is a multiple of the learning rate, the error term from the previous layer, and the input to that layer. As a result, the error term for a given layer is simply a product of the mistakes of all prior levels. When working with activation functions like the sigmoid, the tiny values of its derivatives (found in the error function) are multiplied numerous times as we go closer to the initial layers. As a result, the gradient practically vanishes as a result of this.\n",
        "Recurrent Neural Networks show a similar pattern. RNN only remembers things for short periods of time, thus if we require the knowledge in a short period of time, it may be reproduced, but once a large number of words are put in, it is lost. A slightly adjusted variant of RNNs — the Long Short-Term Memory Networks – can be used to tackle this problem."

        "Understanding how LSTM works may be illustrated by looking at how a news team covering a murder storey works. A news narrative is now constructed on facts, proof, and many people's statements. When a new event happens, you can choose from one of the three options.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's imagine we assumed the murder was carried out by 'poisoning' the victim, but the autopsy report just arrived that said the cause of death was 'an impact on the head.' What do you do as a member of this journalism team? You quickly forget the prior cause of death and all the tales that surrounded it.\n",

        "All of these shattered bits of knowledge can no longer be fed by conventional media. So, once a specific amount of time has passed, you must condense this data and present the pertinent facts to your audience. \"XYZ turns out to be the major suspect,\" for example.\n",

A typical LSTM network is made up of several memory blocks known as cells (the rectangles that we see in the image). The cell state and the concealed state are the two states that are passed to the following cell. The memory blocks are in charge of remembering things, and they are manipulated by three basic mechanisms known as gates. Each of these is detailed further down."

As a result, the sentence's subject is forgotten, and the subject's position is deserted. And when we start talking about \"Dan,\" this subject's place is assigned to \"Dan.\" The forget gate is responsible for this process of forgetting the subject.\n",

The weight matrices are multiplied by the provided inputs, and a bias is applied. This value is then subjected to the sigmoid function. The sigmoid function returns a vector with values ranging from 0 to 1, one for each cell state number. The sigmoid function is in charge of determining which data should be kept and which should be discarded. When the forget gate outputs a '0' for a specific value in the cell state, it signifies that the forget gate wants the cell state to fully forget that piece of information. Similarly, a '1' indicates that the forget gate is active."
